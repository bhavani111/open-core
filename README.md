# OpenCore Dispatch

A blog focused on RISC-V processors, FPGA development, Zephyr RTOS, and open source hardware tools.

## About

OpenCore Dispatch is dedicated to sharing knowledge about:
- üîß RISC-V Development
- ‚ö° FPGA Design with Open Source Tools
- üöÄ Zephyr RTOS
- üõ†Ô∏è Open Source Hardware Tools

## Tech Stack

- **Static Site Generator**: [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- **Template Engine**: Nunjucks
- **Styling**: Custom CSS
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opencore-dispatch.git
cd opencore-dispatch

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:8081/`

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built site will be in the `_site` directory.

To preview the GitHub Pages build locally, run Eleventy with the same path prefix that Pages uses:

```bash
ELEVENTY_PATH_PREFIX=/YOUR_REPO_NAME npm run build
```

The GitHub Actions workflow in this repository calculates the prefix automatically during CI, so you only need this when testing locally.

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel gives you a zero-config deployment for Eleventy.

1. Push your code to GitHub (or another Git provider Vercel supports).
2. Sign up at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (or log in).
3. Click **Add New... ‚Üí Project** and import your repository.
4. When prompted, keep the default build command `npm run build` and output
   directory `_site`, then deploy.
5. After the first deploy, update `src/_data/site.json` so the `url` matches your
   production domain (for example `https://opencore-dispatch.vercel.app`).

This repository includes a `vercel.json` file that pins the Node.js runtime and
ensures Vercel publishes the `_site` directory generated by Eleventy.

### GitHub Pages (Maintained Workflow Included)

This repository includes `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds the site
on every push to `main` and publishes it to GitHub Pages.

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. In **Settings ‚Üí Pages**, choose **GitHub Actions** as the source (the first
   run of the workflow does this automatically).
3. Update `src/_data/site.json` ‚Üí `url` to match the Pages domain
   (for project sites this is usually
   `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO`).

The workflow detects whether the site is a user/org page or a project page and
exports the appropriate `ELEVENTY_PATH_PREFIX` so internal links work without
manual tweaks.

### Cloudflare Pages

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. In Cloudflare Pages, create a new project and connect your repository.
3. Set the build command to `npm run build` and the output directory to `_site`.
4. Save and deploy.

> **Newsletter form note:** This starter is configured for third-party form
> providers. Update `forms.newsletter.endpoint` in `src/_data/site.json` to point
> to your service (for example a [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) endpoint) if
> you want to collect email addresses.
